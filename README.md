### Description

Payroll management is under development process. I am regularly updating it. If you have any suggestion regarding this software then I welcome you.

Please be sure you have set printer's orientation as landscape before using any reports.

Till now it records employee data branch/division wise(if any), their salary details, employee's priority in reports, generates employee's monthly salary, their tax deductions, their incomes, allowances, quaterly medical calculation is automatic, u have to feed just employee's monthly attendance. Employees arrear is another facility.

Reports are very attractive main reports are monthly salary sheet, monthly salary sheet with deductions, salary slip, detailed salary slip, staff detail list.

It support two kinds of users Admin-Normal. normal user have access only on reports. Admin have full access.

U can create new user, change passwords, delete existing one.
